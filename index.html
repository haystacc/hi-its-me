                Hi! I'm Hayden, but you might also hear some people call me Hayho. I'm currently a 2nd year at UNSW,
                doing a degree in Advanced Science (Honours)/ Computer Science, with a major in Psychology.
                <br><br>
                This page is a little look into me, my life, and who I am.
